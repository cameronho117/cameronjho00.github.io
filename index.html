											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I took my first Computer Science course my sophomore year of high school and absolutely fell in love with coding. The fact that it was something very different from the usual subjects, yet something surprisingly familiar, made pursuing coding a must for me. Since that class 6 years ago, I have taken a number of Computer Science related courses, learned many languages, and become familiar with multiple Integrated Development Environments, IDEs. I am a hard worker that does not give up on a problem easily. I also love a challenge and figuring out the solution to the problem is just as satisfying as finishing the problem itself, whether I have to ask for help, do research, or work through the problem by myself, I enjoy the challenge.  </p>

										<h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Comparision</h2>
										<h3> September 2020  - April 2021</h3>
										<p>I was part of a team that compared and analyzed artificial intelligence and machine learning models. We analyzed how fast a model could predict an image and how accurate the prediction was. Using the data that we collected, we compared the outputs to see what made one model faster or more accurate than another. We also created a website to show off our findings and to explain the basics of the AI / ML models that we used. </p>
										<p>If you would like to look at the website we created, click <a href="http://itsclassified-cbu.ml">here</a>.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h2>Social Meet Up Website</h2>
										<h3>January 2020 - April 2020</h3>
										<p>I was the project manager for a team that created a website to help users find others who have similar passions and hobbies, to then schedule a meet up. This website was created in my Design and Documentation course, so the focus of the class was the documentation of the website, such as user cases, user stories, and burndown charts, rather than the website itself. Although not the main objective of the course, we still had to create the website. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h2>Robot Sensing Competition</h2>
										<h3>January 2019 - April 2019</h3>
										<p>I was part of a school robot competition where robots would need to sense different light intensities, voltage, and distance to gain values for another robot to gather points and return them to a bucket. I specifically was part of the sensing unit that gathered the data for calculation. </p>
